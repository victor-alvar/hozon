                {" "}
                Your brand is more than a logo and a killer tagline. It’s a
                promise to your customers that it shows consistency,
                reliability, and quality at every touchpoint.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                It’s also the stories, voice, and values that make your business
                different than the competition. As I’ve discussed in the past,
                strong branding is becoming increasingly important as a digital
                marketing strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                Because organic marketing is becoming a fragmented, omnichannel
                affair, it’s harder to rank on Google or stand out in audiences’
                social feeds.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                While paid advertising (in any format) is still one of the best
                ways to reach your audience, small businesses won’t see much ROI
                unless paid ads are part of a broader branding strategy.

          <div className="heading-title">

              <p className="desc-p">
                {" "}
                Many small businesses don’t do a great job running targeted
                campaigns, even though targeting is one of the key benefits
                associated with online advertising.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                Ad success (and SEO) depends on understanding your audience’s
                motivations and what their intentions are at any given moment in
                the sales cycle.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                As such, your copy and imagery, regardless of platform or
                format, should consistently reflect what you’ve defined in your
                branding strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                To get this right, you’ll need to define your audience personas.
                Otherwise, you may end up spending your entire budget chasing
                the wrong audience.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                When your advertisements match with the right understanding of
                your customers, you’ll begin to attract more valuable leads to
                your business.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                According to research from Internet Retailer, about 95% of sales
                are one-off purchases. They also noticed that returning
                customers account for an average of just 5% of all sales,
                spanning all industries. Traditional coupons and promotions
                might not work for every business model, but you can make some
                adjustments to the strategy to reap the same benefits as
                supermarkets and e-commerce platforms.
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                Consider what you can offer without breaking the bank: Free
                consultations? A BOGO?
              </p>
              <p className="desc-p">
                As you can see, you don’t necessarily need to spend a ton of
                money to promote your business. I should acknowledge, once
                again, that developing great content—be it a compelling
                behind-the-scenes video, a blog post, or writing copy for
                podcasters to read out loud—does require the valuable investment
                of time and maybe some equipment or software to go along.
