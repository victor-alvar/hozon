                The CMS is what you’ll be using to add content, update your
                blog, add images, and do your SEO. It should make sense, have
                built in controls that allow you to determine how your content
                is displayed, and offer the capabilities that your business
                needs, whether an RSS feed for your blog or a shopping cart for
                your e-commerce items.

                One of the most important factors that decides how well a
                website has been SEO optimized is it’s technical performance.
                This is directly impacted by its on page HTML and ability to be
                efficiently crawled. This includes implementing readable URLs,
                Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, Alt Tags, and optimized headings.

                WordPress has become increasingly popular in the past 5 years,
                and it is everywhere. Originally introduced as a free and open
                source blogging platform, WordPress opened itself up with
                innovative widgets to be one of the most popular website
                platforms with thousands of customizable themes, plugins, and
                tools that allow you to do nearly everything you could possibly
                want. Arguably the most SEO-friendly platform – the construction
                of a WordPress site is clean – you won’t run into page
                duplication errors and URL anomalies like you might with another
                CMS that is improperly set up.

                Joomla is a free, open source solution that is a very close
                second in popularity to WordPress. Boasting over 50 million
                downloads to date, it has a robust developer community and is a
                good option for consumers and small-to-medium sized e-commerce
                businesses. There are some drawbacks however, as it is not
                incredibly intuitive to use, and does require SEO extensions in
                order to truly be search-engine friendly. We recommend
                installing sh404SEF to get some necessary SEO configuration
                power – this plugin allows you to make your URLs search engine
                friendly, provides one spot to update your page title and meta
                information, and allows you to easily set up 301 redirects if
                necessary. You can read more here about the settings that should
                be updated before setting your new Joomla site live in order to
                strengthen it’s SEO power.

                Drupal is one of the older CMS platforms out there. It is a
                tremendously powerful open-source system that was designed to be
                SEO friendly. Drupal is best for large scale enterprises – it
                can effortlessly handle hundreds of thousands of pages, and
                thousands of users simultaneously. It is a complicated system,
                however, and should really be left up to the able hands of a
                developer to build, update, and modify. There are no themes or
                free plugins, so you will need a design team and developer to
                build a good user friendly site.

                Magento is a popular open-source ecommerce solution that is now
                owned by eBay. Like WordPress, there are many themes available
                to choose from (including many great responsive themes). Magento
                implements “modules” which offer inherently similar usability
                features to WordPress plugins in that the user is to access a
                library of plugins. Since Magento is open-source – many
                different developers have access to the code and can build and
                improve upon plugins.

                Known for its user friendliness and ease of use, Shopify
                initially debuted as an online store CMS. However, to use
                Shopify to its full potential you must be able to code in
                Liquid, Shopify’s coding language. Shopify is fast for a hosted
                solution and only accepts themes with responsive layouts. Of
                course, it allows you to add meta descriptions, ALT tags,
                customizable URLs, and headers 1 – 6. One slight issue to be
                aware of is the URL needs to be delineated as a collections,
                products, pages, or blogs page which can have some negative SEO
                results but nothing too major. All in all, Shopify is very good
                and has relative ease of use but leave something to be desired.
